 Chada Tech Dual Clock Display – 12-Hour and 24-Hour Format Simulation
Project Summary

This project simulates a dual clock system that displays both 12-hour and 24-hour time formats, meeting the ISO 8601 international standard. The application allows users to increment the time by one hour, minute, or second through a simple menu interface. The objective was to apply key programming concepts such as modular design, input handling, and control flow using C++. The program focuses on clarity, functionality, and maintainability—skills essential in professional software development.

What I Did Well

One of the things I did well in this project was organizing the code into clearly defined, reusable functions. This helped keep the main() function clean and made the overall structure easier to understand and maintain. I also made a point to follow consistent naming conventions and include comments where appropriate, which improved the code’s readability and professionalism. The clock display output was also carefully formatted for visual clarity.

Potential Improvements

If I were to improve the project further, I would focus on enhancing input validation. Currently, the program handles valid numeric input well, but it does not account for invalid or non-numeric entries, which could lead to runtime errors. Adding input validation would make the program more user-friendly and robust. Additionally, encapsulating the clock logic within a class could improve scalability and better demonstrate object-oriented design principles.

Most Challenging Aspects

The most challenging part of the project was handling time rollovers correctly—for example, ensuring that seconds reset to zero and increment minutes properly when reaching 60, and so on with hours. I approached this by breaking the logic into smaller steps and testing each function independently. I referred to the C++ documentation frequently and used developer forums to clarify any uncertainties. These resources proved to be valuable additions to my problem-solving toolkit.

Transferable Skills

Through this project, I developed several transferable skills:

Writing modular, organized code

Debugging logical errors in sequential processes

Using version control tools like Git and GitHub to manage and present my work

These skills are directly applicable to future courses and professional projects, especially those involving user interaction and time-sensitive logic.

Maintainability and Readability

To ensure the code is easy to maintain and update, I used clear and descriptive names for all variables and functions, avoided redundant or hardcoded logic, and added comments to explain key sections of the code. The modular design makes it straightforward to add new features in the future, such as real-time ticking or user-set time input, without needing to rewrite the core logic.
